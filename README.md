 Problem Statement:
 Students struggle to find collaborators with the necessary skills for project execution, hindering creativity and skill development.

 Solution:
 Our platform helps students find project collaborators by matching them based on skills, interests, and experience.

 What makes your solution unique?
 Smart Matching Algorithm: Matches users based on skills, experience, and project needs instead of random suggestions.
 Easy-to-Use UI: Simple, clean, and engaging dashboard with search, projects, and collaborations.
 Future AI Integration: We can later use Machine Learning (ML) to improve project recommendations.

 How does the matching algorithm work?
We use a hybrid approach:
SQL-Based Filtering (Current): Matches users with projects based on skills, interests, and tags stored in the database.
Future AI Model (Later): Uses ML algorithms like KNN or Neural Networks to improve recommendations over time.
